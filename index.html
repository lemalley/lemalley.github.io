        <h1>A Smattering of Design Samples and Projects<br>
            by Laura Malley</h1>
        <h2>A Brief Background</h2>
        <p>I am a one who has long suffered from the desperate need for perfection. Straight lines, clean layout,
             eveningly spaced text- these have always been goals to acheive in school posters and projects since elementary 
            school. I always wanted everything to look as professional as possible. However, it wasn't until I had finished 
            my college years and my achedemic goals had been acheived that I was developed the confidence to pursue my 
            curiousity of learning Adobe's Illusrator or InDesign programs. With the help of my youger brother (no shame!),
            I got my feet wet. It began with a specific project (as most of my challenges have arisen). <br>
            <br>
            I was putting together a reference book for a dear friend of mine's birthday, but it needed a professional cover!</p>

            <br>
            <p>From this first project, there came many, many more. If I didn't know how to do something, I googled it. Google is a 
                designer' (and coder's, I'm now learning) best friend. Any reason I found for doing any kind of design project, I dove 
                into ID and/or AI further. <br>
